## Introduction

**ATP-Client** is the comprehensive user-facing application of the **AIGENDRUG Tool Platform**, providing an intuitive interface for tool discovery, interactive chat-based assistance, and smooth tool execution. This client application connects to ATP-Central to deliver AI-powered tool selection and execution capabilities through a modern, responsive web interface.

The platform enables users to interact with computational tools using natural language, automatically matching user intents with appropriate tools and providing real-time execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For self-hosted deployment:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ with npm/yarn (for development)
- Go 1.22+ (for development)
- Linux environment (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)

### Configuration

Before deployment, you'll need to configure environment variables:

#### Required Environment Variables

**Server Configuration:**

- **ATP_ROUTER_HOST**: ATP-Central service endpoint
- **ATP_ROUTER_API_KEY**: API key for ATP-Central authentication
- **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: Secure password for PostgreSQL database
- **DB_HOST**, **DB_PORT**: Database connection settings
- **PORT**: Server port (default: 8080)
- **RUN_MODE**: Environment mode (release for production, debug for development)

**Client Configuration:**

- **VITE_API_BASE_URL**: Backend API endpoint
- **VITE_WS_URL**: WebSocket connection URL

All configuration options are documented in the `.env.example` file with placeholder values and descriptions.

### Installation

#### Self-Hosted Deployment

The self-hosted setup uses Docker Compose for simplified deployment:

1. **Environment Configuration**

   ```bash
   # Copy environment template and configure your settings
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit the .env file with your actual values:
   # - Set ATP_ROUTER_HOST to your ATP-Central endpoint
   # - Add your ATP_ROUTER_API_KEY
   # - Set POSTGRES_PASSWORD to a secure password
   # - Configure other service settings as needed
   vim .env  # or use your preferred editor
   ```

2. **Deploy All Services**
   ```bash
   # Start all services with Docker Compose
   docker compose up -d
   ```

#### Production Cloud Deployment

For production cloud deployment:

1. **Database**: Deploy PostgreSQL using managed database services
2. **Server**: Deploy to container services with auto-scaling
3. **Web Client**: Deploy to CDN or static hosting services
4. **Load Balancing**: Configure load balancer for high availability
